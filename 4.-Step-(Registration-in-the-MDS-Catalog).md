## Swagger UI

### Register the connector in the MDS Catalog 

1. Browse to the Swagger UI. If you have your connector running locally on port 8080 this would be https://localhost:8080/api/docs 
<br>Please note, that the application uses Spring Security. Each endpoint behind /** needs a [user authentication](https://international-data-spaces-association.github.io/DataspaceConnector/Deployment/Configuration#authentication).
2. Scroll down to the [IDS Messages](https://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config#/IDS%20Messages) section. 
3. Open the [Connector Update Message](https://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config#/IDS%20Messages/sendConnectorUpdateMessage_3)
4. Select __Try it out__ on the right hand side.
5. Enter the MDS Catalog URL as the recipient URL and select __Execute__.
* The URL for the MDS Test Catalog is https://broker.test.mobility-dataspace.eu/infrastructure
* The URL for the MDS Productive Catalog is https://broker.mobility-dataspace.eu/infrastructure <br>
**Note: Please do not use the MDS Productive Catalog for test purposes.**

If everything worked fine, the connector is now available in the MDS Catalog.

### Unregister the connector

In the [IDS Messages](https://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config#/IDS%20Messages) section use the [Connector unavailable message](https://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config#/IDS%20Messages/sendConnectorUpdateMessage_4) and follow steps 4-5 from above to unregister your connector.
