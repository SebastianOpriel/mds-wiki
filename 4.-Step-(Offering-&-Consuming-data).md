With the Dataspace Connector you can consume and provide data via the MDS Dataspace Connector UI.

# Consume Data
## Consume Data Searching Broker via Broker Frontend
You can access the frontend of the MDS Catalog and browse all registered resources. If you find a data resource to be consumed, copy the base path of the `Original ID` e.g. `https://ids.ivi-test-connector.mobilitydataspace.io` without the `/api/offers/...` suffix, and append `/api/ids/data` for the next step. 

In case you found a connector (connector tab of MDS Catalog), you can copy the whole `Access URL` which shall already contain `/api/ids/data` as suffix. 

Proceed with [Consume Data with known Connector URL](#Consume-Data-with-known-Connector-URL)

## Consume Data with known Connector URL
1. Go to <kbd>Data Consumption</kbd> >> <kbd>Requests</kbd> >> <kbd>Request Resource</kbd> at the MDS Dataspace Connectors UI and enter the URL of the Connector, whose data shall be requested. Be aware to use the access URL endpoint which ends on `/api/ids/data` (e.g. https://ids.ivi-test-connector.mobilitydataspace.io/api/ids/data). Press <kbd>SHOW AVAILABLE RESOURCES</kbd> button.

## Consume Data Searching Broker via MDS Dataspace Connector UI
Instead of step 1. of [# Consume Data with known Connector URL](#Consume-Data-with-known-Connector-URL) you can click on <kbd>BROKER</kbd> tab and select the registered Catalog from the dropdown menu. You can enter a search term to find resources registered in the selected Catalog. Proceed then by pressing the <kbd>Request resource</kbd> button on the right side of a resource and follow further steps as you of aforementioned step 2.  


# Data offering
1. To offer data you need to define the data offering first. Go to <kbd>Data Offering</kbd> >> <kbd>Offerings</kbd> >> <kbd>Add Offering</kbd> of MDS Dataspace Connector UI and describe your meta-data first. You can set 
   * Title: The title of your data
   * Description: A more detailed description of your data offering
   * Publisher (as URL): The owner of the data you are offering
   * Keywords: To describe the data offering with keywords and make it searchable inside Broker. Separate keywords with a comma. 
   * License (as URL): Terms under which your data shall be processed (e.g. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)
   * Language: The inherent language of your data
   * Payment Modality: Usually selected as free  
   
   **Please be aware that this information is accurate and complete**. These fields represent your offer in the MDS catalog.

2. The Mobility Data Space uses the [MDS Ontology](https://github.com/Mobility-Data-Space/mobility-data-space/wiki/Ontology) for description of additional mobility related metadata attributes. We strongly recommend to select a suitable data category at <kbd>Additional</kbd> tab:
   * Data Category (mandatory, enumeration)
   * Data Subcategory (optional, enumeration)
   * Transport Mode (optional, enumeration)
   * Data Model (optional, free string)
   * Geo Reference Method (optional, free string)

3. Create a new usage policy pattern or use a template if available and acceptable and click the <kbd>NEXT</kbd> button.

4. Define an artifact you want to offer as
   * a local file (file upload): Set a mime type if not automatically set as `file type`, e.g. `application/json` 
   * an external data source: You can choose between a REST-API with different authentication types (none, basic auth or API key) or connecting to a database and filtering data with an SQL query.

5. Add a catalog for your offer or use an existing one. This catalog serves the purpose to group your data offerings in your Dataspace Connector, i.e. a directory for data offers originating from the same domain (e.g., mobility data) or fulfilling similar purposes. Please don't mix up this catalog (as a feature of a Dataspace Connector) with the MDS Catalog.

6. Select the MDS Catalog where your data offering shall be published to.

Your data offering is now available at the MDS Catalog.
