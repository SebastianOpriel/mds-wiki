## Secure issuing of the MDS certificates

Certificate will no longer we send by email but alternatively via a shared fileshare, that require your registration in the first step and will be secured by a 2 FA (factor authentication).<br>
To request connector certificates (both for productive and test stage) simply register at https://registration.mobility-dataspace.eu

The registration process is according to the market standards simple and just requires to follow the steps. Once you are registered you can log in via your credentials (email & password). <br>
**We stronly recommend to secure your account by 2-Faktor-Authentication after the first logging.**
To achieve this you need to click _Einstellungen->OTP tile_. If you have already used 2FA in the past the following process will look quite familiar. The process is anyway explained further.

There are many 2FA applications for mobile devices but we do recommend the use of Google Authenticator or freeOTP application the can be downloaded free of charge for Android and iPhone. Once you have downloaded and started the app you can scan the QR code shown on the registration website – thats all.

Whenever you login from now on you will be asked the second authentication factor by the truzztbox website. Therefore, open the Google Authenticator or freeOTP app, click on the truzzt entry and enter the provided code into the field on the website. <br>

To obtain certificates for the **MDS Test Stage** please switch the mode in the upper right corner to the _Test Mode_ Please enter the domain of your connector. Please note that on the test stage the domain will not be checked by DAPS.

To obtain certificates for the **MDS Productive Stage** don't switch the mode. Please enter the domain of your connector (e.g. **ids.ivi-con-nector.mobilitydataspace.io**). During interim operation, this information was not checked by DAPS. Now this field "referringConnector" will be checked in the productive environment to increase system security. Please make sure that your connector domain is correct and that it is entered correctly (**without https://**) during the certificate creation request.

For the connector configuration you will need the p12. certificate from the zip-file you downloaded.
