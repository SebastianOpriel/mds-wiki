If you want your data offerings to be visible to others, you need to register your connector at MDS Broker. If you use the provided example files, your connector is already bootstrapped and thus automatically registered at the MDS Broker at startup. Therefore, you can skip the registering section. In case you want to unregister your connector from the Broker, you may proceed below.
