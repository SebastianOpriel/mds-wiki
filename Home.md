The overview of the Mobility Data Space with explanations about component functionalities and currently deployed environments you find [here](https://github.com/Mobility-Data-Space/mobility-data-space/wiki/Architecture-Overview).

In these documents several abbreviations and technical component names are used. Please see the official [glossary](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G/blob/main/Glossary/README.md) of International Data Spaces for further explanation or [Reference Architecture Model](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-RAM_4_0) for detailed explanation.


# Access to the Mobility Data Space 
After the contract signing you get access to the Mobility Data Space in simple steps (estimated time for the test implementation is about one hour).

1. **Connector Certificate**  
Register your connector to obtain your unique MDS Connector Certificate.


2. **Connector Setup and Configuration**  
We recommend to use the [Dataspace Connector](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector) and its [MDS Dataspace Connector UI](https://github.com/Mobility-Data-Space/DataspaceConnectorUI/releases), which is used as reference for configuration. Nevertheless, you can use any other connector which is compatible with the Dataspace Connector, MDS Catalog and MDS Clearing House.


3. **Registration in the MDS Catalog**  
Register your connector in the MDS Catalog.


4. **Offering & Consuming data**  
Congratulations! Now you can offer and/or consume mobility data via the MDS infrastructure.
