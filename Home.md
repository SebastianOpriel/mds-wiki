# Welcome to the Mobility Data Space

## Overview of the Mobility Data Space 

The overview of the Mobility Data Space with explanations about component functionalities and currently deployed environments you can find [hier](https://github.com/Mobility-Data-Space/mobility-data-space/wiki/MDS-Architecture)

## Access to the Mobility Data Space 

After the contract signing with the Mobility Data Space you can get an access to the MDS in five simple steps (estimated time for the test implementation is one hour). <br>

### [First Step (Software installation)](https://github.com/Mobility-Data-Space/mobility-data-space/wiki/1.-Step-(Software-installation))
Download the connector. We recommend to use the [Dataspace Connector](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector), but you also can use other connectors which are compatible with the DSC. <br>
Optional but strongly recommended: Download and install the MDS Frontend.

### [Second Step (Certificates)](https://github.com/Mobility-Data-Space/mobility-data-space/wiki/2.-Step-(Certificates))
Register your connector to obtain your unique MDS certificate (so called DAPS token)

### [Third Step (Configuration)](https://github.com/Mobility-Data-Space/mobility-data-space/wiki/3.-Step-(Configuration))
Configure your connector before starting.

### [Fourth Step (Registration in the Catalog)](https://github.com/Mobility-Data-Space/mobility-data-space/wiki/4.-Step-(Registration-in-the-MDS-Catalog))
Register your connector in the MDS Catalog. <br>

### [Fifth Step (Offering & Consuming data)](https://github.com/Mobility-Data-Space/mobility-data-space/wiki/5.-Step-(Offering-&-Consuming-data))
Congratulations! Now you can offer and/or consume mobility data via MDS.
