# Welcome to Mobility Data Space

## Access to Mobility Data Space 

To get access to the data room with your connector, you first need a valid DAPS token. You can request this token under [Requested & Issued Demo certificates](https://industrialdataspace.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-2002) or directly from [Gerd Brost](https://www.dataspaces.fraunhofer.de/de/software/identity_provider.html).

If you are using the [Dataspace Connector](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector), you can configure your connector with tokens as described under  [Dataspace Connector-Configuration](https://international-data-spaces-association.github.io/DataspaceConnector/Deployment/Configuration). Now you can connect your connector e.g. to one of the brokers to publish your own resources or request resources from other connectors in the dataspace.

## Stages
There are two separate stages or environments of the Mobility Data Space. There is a test environment and a demo environment. As the name implies, the test environment is used to test new connectors and resources. 
If you have a new connector, you should first test it in the test environment.

### Test environment
An overview of the test environment can be found here: https://logging.test.mobilitydataspace.io/

#### Broker / Metadata Catalog
The user interface of the broker can be found at https://broker.test.mobilitydataspace.io/resources
The IDS interface for publishing a resource can be found at https://ids.broker.test.mobilitydataspace.io/infrastructure

### Demo environment
An overview of the test environment can be found here: https://logging.mobilitydataspace.io/

#### Broker / Metadata Catalog
The user interface of the broker can be found at https://broker.mobilitydataspace.io/resources  
The IDS interface for publishing a resource can be found at https://ids.broker.mobilitydataspace.io/infrastructure.
