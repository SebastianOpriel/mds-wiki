# Welcome to Mobility Data Space

## Access to Mobility Data Space 

To get access to the data room with your connector, you first need a valid DAPS token. You can request this token under Requested & Issued Demo certificates or directly from Gerd Brost.
If you are using the Dataspace Connector, you can configure your connector with tokens as described under  Dataspace Connector-Configuration. Now you can connect your connector e.g. to one of the brokers to publish your own resources or request resources from other connectors in the dataspace.

## Stages
There are two separate stages or environments of the Mobility Data Space. There is a test environment and a demo environment. As the name implies, the test environment is used to test new connectors and resources. 
If you have a new connector, you should first test it in the test environment.

### Test environment
