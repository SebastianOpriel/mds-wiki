To access the Mobility Data Space in a convenient way you have to install and configure the Dataspace Connector and the MDS Dataspace Connector UI.

Generally, two ways exist, to get the connector and its UI up and running: Either you download the source code and run it locally or you use docker-images and start everything via docker-compose. We recommend using docker-compose!

_Expected audience of this tutorial: We assume, the reader of this tutorial to be familiar with software development and software deployment in corporate infrastructures. Thus, no introduction is given to setup the basics like Java, Docker, etc. Please also note to secure the Dataspace Connector and MDS Dataspace Connector UI (change passwords, use reverse proxy, etc.)_ 


# MDS Test environment
## Docker approach
1. Copy all files from deployment example repository folder [Mobility-Data-Space/dsc-deployment-example/docker-test-environment](Mobility-Data-Space/dsc-deployment-example/docker-test-environment): 
   * docker-compose.yml
   * conf/bootstrap.properties
   * conf/brokerCatalog.jsonld
   * conf/config.json
   * conf/keystore.p12
   * conf/truststore.p12


2. Adjust `docker-compose.yml` to your needs:
   * If run in an infrastructure with a reverse proxy, you might want to disable `SERVER_SSL_ENABLED` as your reverse proxy most probably will terminate TLS. Otherwise, you need to add your x509 certificate for TLS connections to the `keystore.p12` file.
   * Replace default passwords (`SPRING_SECURITY_USER_NAME` and `SPRING_SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD` as well as `CONNECTOR_USER` and `CONNECTOR_PASSWORD`).
   
   _Further information about how to configure Dataspace Connector can be found [here](https://international-data-spaces-association.github.io/DataspaceConnector/Deployment/Configuration) and [here](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-Messaging-Services/wiki/09.-Settings:-Connector-Configuration)._  
   Be aware that `application.properties` variable names must be camel cased for docker (see [Spring Boot Docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config)).


3. Adjust `config.json`
   * Set `@id` of JSON root to the URL where your connector's root will be available (e.g., `"@id" : "https://ids.ivi-test-connector.mobilitydataspace.io"` or `"@id" : "https://localhost:8080"`)
   * Set `@id` of `ids:accessURL` to the URL where your connector's root will be available and append `/api/ids/data` (e.g., `"@id" : "https://ids.ivi-test-connector.mobilitydataspace.io/api/ids/data"` or `"@id" : "https://localhost:8080/api/ids/data"`)
   * Set `@value` of `ids:title` element to your desired connector name (e.g., `"@value" : "DRM Datenraum Mobilit채t GmbH Dataspace Connector"`
   * Set `@value` of `ids:description` element to your desired connector description (e.g., `An MDS Datasapce Connector of DRM Datenraum Mobilit채t GmbH for demonstration purposes`)
   * Set `@id` of `ids:curator` to the URL of the connector curator (e.g., `https://ivi.fraunhofer.de`)
   * Set `@id` of `ids:maintainer` to the URL of the connector maintainer (e.g., `https://sovity.de`)  
   _Please note, that there is no logical link between the Dataspace connector's deploy mode `TEST_DEPLOYMENT` / `PRODUCTIVE_DEPLOYMENT` (see [here](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-Messaging-Services/wiki/10.-Settings:-Connector-Deploy-Modes) and [here](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector/blob/4a39a8a4de71c0668a12669c233fc0614fb79ab2/src/main/resources/conf/config.json#L11)) and the Mobility Data Space's _test environment_ / _productive environment_. In both environments, you need to set the Dataspace Connector's deploy mode to `PRODUCTIVE_DEPLOYMENT` to register your connector at the Catalog._


4. General settings
    * Rename the downloaded certificate p12-file to `keystore.p12` and copy it to the conf folder, overriding the existing `keystore.p12`.  
      _Hint: If you need to use another file name, you can adjust the file name of keystore in `config.json` at `ids:keyStore` entry._
    * Protect access to the UI via your infrastructure (e.g. IP restriction or add Basic Auth)!


5. Start containers via console
    * Be aware to be logged-in into ghcr.io to be able to pull the images. See [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry)
    * Run `docker-compose up -d`
    * Use credentials set as `SPRING_SECURITY_USER_NAME` and `SPRING_SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD` to log-in into Swagger UI: https://localhost:8080/api/docs  
    * MDS Dataspace Connector UI: http://localhost:8083


6. Stop via console `docker-compose down`


## Source Code Approach for local testing
_Warning: It is not recommended to use the source code for infrastructure deployments. Source Code approach is just intended for local testing purposes._

### Dataspace Connector
1. Install Java, Maven and [Node.js v.14](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


2. Download source code of the [latest release of Dataspace Connector](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector/releases).


3. Adjust Dataspace Connector's settings
   * Adjust `src/main/resources/conf/config.json`
     * Set `@id` of JSON root to the URL where your connector's root will be available (e.g., `"@id" : "https://localhost:8080"`)
     * Set `@id` of `ids:accessURL` to the URL where your connector's root will be available and append `/api/ids/data` (e.g., `"@id" : "https://localhost:8080/api/ids/data"`)
     * Set `@id` of `ids:title` to your desired connector name (e.g., `"@id" : "DRM Datenraum Mobilit채t GmbH Dataspace Connector"`
     * Set connector description (e.g., `An MDS Datasapce Connector of DRM Datenraum Mobilit채t GmbH for demonstration purposes`)
     * Set `@id` of `ids:curator` to the URL of the connector curator (e.g., `https://mobility-dataspace.eu`)
     * Set `@id` of `ids:maintainer` to the URL of the connector maintainer (e.g., `https://sovity.de`)
     * Set the `ids:keyStore` to the path of your received p12-file
     * Set `@id` of `ids:connectorDeployMode` to `idsc:PRODUCTIVE_DEPLOYMENT`   
     _Please note, that there is no logical link between the Dataspace connector's deploy mode `TEST_DEPLOYMENT`/`PRODUCTIVE_DEPLOYMENT` (see [here](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-Messaging-Services/wiki/10.-Settings:-Connector-Deploy-Modes) and [here](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector/blob/4a39a8a4de71c0668a12669c233fc0614fb79ab2/src/main/resources/conf/config.json#L11)) and the Mobility Data Space's _test environment_ and _productive environment_. In both environments, you need to set the Dataspace Connector's deploy mode to `PRODUCTIVE_DEPLOYMENT` to register your connector at the Catalog._
   * Adjust `src/main/resources/application.properties`
     * Set Clearing House and DAPS properties:  
       ```
       clearing.house.url=https://clearing.test.mobility-dataspace.eu/logs/messages/
       daps.url=https://daps.test.mobility-dataspace.eu
       daps.token.url=https://daps.test.mobility-dataspace.eu/token
       daps.key.url=https://daps.test.mobility-dataspace.eu/jwks.json
       daps.incoming.dat.default.wellknown=/jwks.json
       daps.whitelisted.url=https://daps.test.mobility-dataspace.eu
       ```
       _Info: To ensure traceability and auditability of transactions in the MDS, we require our participants to use the Clearing House on the productive stage. Clearing House only logs metadata (transaction ID, timestamp)._
     * You most probably run your code on a local machine without a public URL pointing to your machine (e.g. https://ids.ivi-test-connector.mobilitydataspace.io). In that case, you need to set `referred.check=false`.
   * Replace `src/main/resources/conf/keystore.p12` with your received keystore
   * Add `bootstrap.properties` and `brokerCatalog.jsonld` to `src/main/resources/bootstrap` and adjust `bootstrap.path=./src/main/resources/bootstrap` accordingly as well as enabling bootstrapping via `bootstrap.enabled=true` property.


4. Start Dataspace Connector
   * Open a console and cd into source folder
   * `mvn clean compile`
   * `mvn spring-boot:run`


5. Access the connector
   * Use credentials set as `spring.security.user.name` and `spring.security.user.password` of application.properties to log-in into Swagger UI: https://localhost:8080/api/docs

## Further information on Dataspace Connector configuration
You can find more information about how to configure the Dataspace Connector in its documentation at https://international-data-spaces-association.github.io/DataspaceConnector/Deployment/Configuration

### MDS Dataspace Connector UI
1. Download source code of the [latest release of MDS Dataspace Connector UI](https://github.com/Mobility-Data-Space/DataspaceConnectorUI/releases).


2. Install the backend (src/backend folder): `npm install`


3. Start the backend (src/backend folder): `npm start`


4. Install the UI (root folder): `npm install --no-audit`


5. Start the UI (root folder) `npm start serve`.


6. Access MDS Dataspace Connector UI: http://localhost:8082
   ![MDS Dataspace Connector UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91048868/169023128-e79a8770-0469-4264-9894-9ceed79deba8.jpg "Dataspace Connector UI")

### Verify Configuration
Using <kbd>Advanced View</kbd> >> <kbd>Settings</kbd> >> <kbd>General</kbd> of the UI, you can verify your configuration changes. Please ensure that this information is accurate and complete as these fields represent the connector in the MDS catalog. 
![MDS Dataspace Connector UI Settings Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91048868/169081507-66ef0389-08ab-47ac-a240-4e588a9e6752.jpg "Dataspace Connector UI Settings Page")

In addition, you can access connectors actuator page at https://localhost:8080/actuator/info to verify if a valid DAT could be acquired.

Please note, that there is no logical link between the _Test mode_ of the Dataspace Connector and the Mobility Data Space _Test environment_. You need to use the **Productive mode** of the Dataspace Connector to work in the MDS **Test environment**.


# MDS Productive environment
Please follow steps for MDS Test environment above, but make use of example files for productive environment at [Mobility-Data-Space/dsc-deployment-example/docker-productive-environment](Mobility-Data-Space/dsc-deployment-example/docker-productive-environment). Major difference of these files are, that MDS URLs of Broker, DAPS and Clearing House point to the productive environment.

## Docker approach
As stated above, the productive environment is pretty the same setup as the test environment, but with differences regarding targeted infrastructure URLs.
* Clearing House and DAPS environment variables are pointing to productive environment:
  ```
    CLEARING_HOUSE_URL=https://clearing.mobility-dataspace.eu/logs/messages/
    DAPS_URL=https://daps.mobility-dataspace.eu
    DAPS_TOKEN_URL=https://daps.mobility-dataspace.eu/token
    DAPS_KEY_URL=https://daps.mobility-dataspace.eu/jwks.json
    DAPS_INCOMING_DAT_DEFAULT_WELLKNOWN=/jwks.json
    DAPS_WHITELISTED_URL=https://daps.mobility-dataspace.eu
  ```
* Be aware to use p12 generated for productive environment.

## Source Code approach for productive environment
Stop, don't do that! Make use of Docker, Kubernetes, etc.
