## Components

To be added

## Stages
There are two separate stages or environments of the Mobility Data Space. There is a test environment and a productive environment. As the name implies, the test environment is used to test new connectors and resources. 
If you implemented or installed a new connector, you should first test it in the test environment.

Please note, that there is no logical link between the _test mode_ of the Dataspace Connector and the Mobility Data Space _test environment_. You need to use the **productive mode** of the Dataspace Connector to register in the **test environment** Catalog.
